## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-09

First real release: the platform-neutral **driver core** (roadmap M2). thoth is
a DRIVER — it owns no domain logic and reaches the AGNOS spine
(hoosh/daimon/bote/t-ron/avatara) through capability seams that are all
**absent** in 0.1.0. The agent loop is real; model-backed reasoning, MCP tools,
and authorization are not wired yet, and degrade honestly. SemVer `0.x` per
[ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-semver-pre-release.md).

### Added
- **Interactive REPL/TUI driver** (`src/repl.cyr`, `src/main.cyr`): a
  read → dispatch → iterate loop over a portable buffered line reader.
- **Commands** (`src/commands.cyr`): `/help`, `/seams`, `/state`, `/model`,
  `/read`, `/write`, `/run`, `/quit`, plus free-text input routed as a coding
  task. Pure `classify_input` / `token_is` / `arg_after` helpers.
- **Capability-seam registry** (`src/seams.cyr`): the five spine seams with
  status (all `absent`); `/seams` renders the capability ladder honestly.
- **Fail-closed authorization gate**: `/run` and `/write` name their target and
  deny by default, proceeding only on explicit `y` — the t-ron-absent
  degrade-closed posture, made real.
- **Local shell escape** (`src/exec.cyr`): `/run` runs `/bin/sh -c` via the
  portable `process.cyr` surface (explicit argv), streaming output and
  reporting the real exit code.
- **Session state + persona** (`src/session.cyr`): turn/model state and the
  static avatara Thoth/Librarian banner descriptor.
- **47-assertion unit suite** (`tests/thoth.tcyr`) over the pure logic.
- Project identity + the OS-agnostic/AGNOS-primary design: `CLAUDE.md`,
  `README.md`, `docs/development/{state,roadmap}.md`, ADR-0001..0004,
  architecture note 001, and the required root files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).

### Changed
- `cyrius.cyml`: `version` → `${file:VERSION}` (was an inlined `0.1.0`); real
  `description`; added `repository`; `[build].output` → `build/thoth`; added
  `process` / `result` / `tagged` stdlib deps for the portable shell escape.
- Standards links repointed from the stale `docs/development/applications/…`
  path to `docs/development/first-party/…`.

### Security
- `/run` and `/write` are gated by a fail-closed confirm that denies by default
  (stands in for the absent t-ron seam) and names the object being authorized.
- `/run` uses explicit argv via `exec_vec` — no `sys_system` with unsanitized
  data. `/read` is read-only and ungated by design; a real sandbox/authorization
  posture belongs to the t-ron seam, not an in-tree allowlist (see ADR-0001).
