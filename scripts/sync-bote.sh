# Re-sync the vendored bote MCP core bundle.
#
# bote is consumed as a single committed file, src/vendor/bote-core.cyr,
# rather than via a [deps.bote] block in cyrius.cyml. The reason (learned
# by hoosh first): bote's manifest declares [deps.libro] + [deps.majra]
# git sub-deps (for its full bundle's events_majra / audit_libro modules).
# `cyrius deps` resolves those transitively, vendoring libro/majra →
# bayan/ganita/agnosys into the compile set, where the agnos superset
# collides with bote-core's registry_new and trips an agnosys
# slice-include error. The core bundle (`dist/bote-core.cyr`, bote's
# [lib.core] profile) is fully self-contained — 9 transport-free modules,
# no includes, no libro/majra symbols — so we vendor just that file and
# skip the dep machinery entirely.
#
# Living under src/ (not a top-level vendor/) keeps `cyrius vet` happy:
# cyaudit trusts the authored src tree; a top-level vendor/ file reads as
# untrusted.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/sync-bote.sh [tag]   (default: 3.1.1)
